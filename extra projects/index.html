            <p class="big">We make Live, Push and Link — unique software and hardware for music creation and
                performance. With these
                products, our community of users creates amazing things.</p>
            <p class="small">Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products
                are used by a community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.</p>

            <p class="big">Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow,
                it’s incredibly rewarding.</p>
            <p class="small">We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our
                passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <p class="big">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in
                Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
            <p class="small">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every
                day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of
                us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
                culture.</p>

            <p class="big">We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a few
                products and we strive to make them great.</p>
            <p class="small">Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they
                need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building
                teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives.
                We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>

                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
                skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and
                music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

            <p class="small">If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even
                provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect
                comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity
                leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings
                throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
