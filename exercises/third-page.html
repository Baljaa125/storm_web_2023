    <h1>Welcome to my exercise plan</h1>
    <p>Are you ready to get started on your fitness journey?
        This simple exercise plan will help you build a foundation
        for a healthier and more active lifestyle.</p>
    <h2>Day 1: Walking</h2>
    <p>Start with a 15-minute brisk walk around your neighborhood
        or a nearby park. Focus on maintaining good posture and breathing rhythmically.</p>
    <h3>Day 2: Stretching</h3>
    <p>Perform a 10-minute stretching routine to improve flexibility.
        Include stretches for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and back.</p>
    <h4>Day 3: Squats</h4>
    <p>Do 3 sets of 10 squats. Squats are great for building lower body strength.
        Keep your back straight, and go as low as you comfortably can.</p>
